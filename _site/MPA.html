<p><font color="black"> Recognize that you will never be perfect. Mark
professes that he still makes mistakes even after 40-years of trading.
The difference, however, is that his mistakes are very small and never
hurt him too much. Do you know when you’ve made a mistake?</p>
<p>Ensure you first have the <b>knowledge</b> and then with that
knowledge you develop the <b>skills and discipline</b> to execute your
knowledge.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Holding Losses</li>
</ol>
<p>MM commented about how MR has NEVER had an issue with cutting losses
and I would say that I, too, have literally never questioned cutting a
loss. He said that MR is an anomaly and must be within the 0.10% club
b/c it’s such a common error. MM said he had issues with this for
~5-years in the beginning.</p>
<p>Being consistent requires CONSTANT management of your risk to reward
and if you can’t cut losses you don’t have a chance. Mark has witnessed
people wipeout 10-15 years of growth and hardwork in the market due to
one bad bear market. This has led to health problems, suicide, etc. You
must learn to be a hawk at all times.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Overtrading</li>
</ol>
<p>MR struggled with overtrading in the beginning. He has made progress
by paying very close attention to his most-recent trades and combining
this with knowing what he wants to see to know that “the wind is at our
backs.” Are you seeing pivots failing, squats, etc.? If so, that type of
market action should have you trading less by default. I struggle with
overtrading. This became evident during this last rally and my solution
was practically the same - add 10-most recent trades on my “Positions”
page.</p>
<p>The most common reason for overtrading in MM experience, is when
people are buying good setups in a poor market. THEY HAVE TO BE WORKING.
You have to bring trades into context. Overtrading can manifest itself
in selling winners too soon. So you’re taking gains at 6% and losses at
6% too. It can manifest itself in many ways. Most importantly, listen to
MR. Look at your recent trades (feedback) and take market environment
strongly into consideration.</p>
<p>Overtrading is especially tempting for folks who are new and
full-time. You sit in front of the screen all day and feel you need to
do something.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Forcing Trades</li>
</ol>
<p>Most common reasons why people force trades: (1) you want action/to
be in the game, (2) pressure to outperform the market or other people,
(3) pressured by losses and want to recoup.</p>
<p>Do PTA. Do PTA. Do PTA.</p>
<p>Looking at a less-than-ideal trade that MM highlighted: QCOM in
Dec. 2021. Stopped following the bearish engulfing. Was this ideal?
No. It was not strong enough to be a PP, it was a short, extended base
(not PP) and MM already knows that he has a poor track record with these
setups. Big cap stock that was likely on everyone’s radar.</p>
<p>These three things compound eachother. You hold losses, which likely
leads to you wanting to recoup your losses which results in overtrading
and/or forcing trades. The flip side, however, is that GOOD DECISIONS in
the marketplace COMPOUND each other too. Trading creates a lot of
emotional pressure. </font></p>

<p>These things build on each other and you have to build them one at a
time. They support each other, like legs of a table. Also, recognize
that you can’t necessarily perfect these things. Like selling. However,
your goal should be to minimize these errors as much as possible,
especially FOMO. This should be as close to eliminated as possible.
Anyone ever golf an 18? Were always improving and even Mark M. admits
that there’s only a handful of things on the list (twitter poll) that
he’s perfect at, like: cutting losses, executing at buy point (and not
chasing). When you consider the majority of things on that list, he’s a
work in progress. Always looking to learn and improve. You will be
forever!</p>
<p>Consider learning each of these topics as little journeys. Their
little journeys within a much larger journey that is your stock trading
career.</p>
<p>Consider adding a ‘tag’ to your trades that identifies the type of
base / pattern you’re buying. Then go back and analyze how those setups
perform for YOU. Either way, when doing PTA, analyze them according to
setup type.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sit out Power</li>
</ol>
<p>FOMO is what makes it so difficult to sit out. Nowadays were all
equipped with a machine gun and able to buy whatever and whenever. But
you shouldn’t be doing that. <b> It takes one or two good periods to
realize the value of waiting for them. </b></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>FOMO</li>
</ol>
<p>HAVE RULES. Remove all the emotional, on the spot decisions. Being as
mechanical as possible is the key to eliminate FOMO. If you’re
susceptible to FOMO, you need to build protection mechanisms (like
having rules for everything and planning everything out ahead of time).
Just like an ex-alcoholic: don’t go to a party where everyone is
drinking, build protection mechanisms!</p>
<p>MR: “I used to chase gaps”, for example. Seems like they gap up and
just go, however, in doing that over time, he realized that it just
doesn’t pay on average. Then, follow the stats of those trades and see
how they play out. This is partly how Mark became so picky about
low-risk entry points. If I do this 1,000 times, where am I? Put in your
journal that you made a FOMO trade. Track them and see if they pay.. <b>
The goal is to make money. Are you a business man? Is this a hobby
that’s filling a need for excitement / exhilaration? </b></p>

<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>If you’re not doing well, either your criteria/discipline is flawed
or the market is poor. That’s it.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Batting Average</li>
</ol>
<p>You have no control over your batting average. In trading, you will
be wrong often. The trick is not figuring out how to be right all the
time (or improve your batting avg), it’s figuring out how to be
profitable while knowing that you will be wrong often. <b>During tough
periods, your batting avg may only be 20%, this is where you have to
figure out how not to lose money.</b> One way to do this, finance risk
ASAP (even at 1:1) and free roll the rest. It’s learning how to adapt
the factors that you can control (position sizing, avg loss) while
knowing that your batting average will be low and you cannot control
it.</p>
<p>If you can figure out how not to lose during tough periods, you’re
going to do really well during the easy dollar periods. Either figure
out how to finance risk quickly or exercise <b> sit out power.</b></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whipsaw Markets</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t worry about profitability. Just worry about breaking even and
getting feedback from the market. Recall “Mind blowing math” if you can
break even during the bad periods and be there for the good periods, you
can make a fortune. You don’t need to be making money every day, it
comes in bunches. You don’t need much time, you just need to NOT
lose.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Following Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Have very clearly defined and established protocols. Get very
mechanical. If new, keep it very basic and limit yourself to a very
select set of circumstances from which you buy. As minimal # of moving
parts as possible. Narrow it down to top 5 or 10% RS names. Always stay
within your own emotional limits.</p>

</center>
<div class="box1">
<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>Always ask yourself where you would be if you made ‘X’ decision 100
times. It’s all about risk-to-reward. The stock market presents
tremendous opportunity and it also presents tremendous risk. However,
the beautiful thing about the stock market, unlike anything else, is you
can choose to keep risk very small and sell out as soon as you want. You
can be wrong a huge # of times and still make a fortune.</p>
<p>On a breakout to new highs, very often (between 40-60% depending on
the market), the stock will pullback to the breakout point. Be careful
setting a breakeven stop too soon. A pullback to the buy point is less
likely on pullback buys. Several ways to manage risk after a breakout,
one way is to cut stop in half, from -5% to -2.5% for example, <b>or to
wait until it clears the high of the first natural reaction.</b></p>
<p>After buying a breakout, Mark looks for: follow through on volume.
The sooner the better. Then, if it pulls back, look for support on 3
lower low’s ideally on light volume. 3-4 lower low’s. We want high
volume out and low volume in. Getting support on the 3rd lower low is a
sign of institutional support and ‘tennis ball action.’</p>
<p>Violations to consider after the breakout: Does it close below the
20-DMA? High volume coming back into the breakout area? You should be
reducing your position (even before it hits the stop) if you see
violations piling up and don’t stubbornly hang in there.</p>
<p>Marks average loss is generally 3.5-6%. Mark buys post-earnings gaps
or PEG’s. Looks at this like a short stroke and must have all the usual
characteristics. SANM during ~Aug 2014 is an example of a solid PEG
setup.</p>

that as a decent sized gain. Now you want to look to protect the gain,

<p>The time to think like an ‘investor’ is at the beginning of a new
bull market, just after a long bear. This is where you can get much
longer, sustained moves. If you’re on a key leader, upside could be huge
and it’s worth considering holding a small piece (at least) for a large
move. Realize that by doing this, however, you’ll have to hold through
major corrections, undercuts of significant lows and several
base-building phases.</p>
<p>When entering a PowerPlay setup or when buying from an IPO base.
Powerplay is a velocity setup. IPO base is a magnitude setup. Both have
potential to make huge moves.</p>
<p><u>How:</u></p>
<p>One way to manage the position while holding for a larger move is
using the <b>breakeven or better rule</b> where you use the 50-day MA as
a trailing stop. That is, once the 50-day MA is at the same level/price
as your buy point, you switch over to using a close below the 50-day MA
as a trailing stop. This helps you stay in there and hold for a larger
move. Your breakeven stop turns into a trailing stop.</p>

<p>Very important to watch the stock immediately after placing the
trade. <b> The best sign that you’re going to make money on the trade is
when you have the breakout followed by at least 2-3 additional days of
buying. These get away from the breakout quickly and are “hard to buy”.
</b> It’s all about know what to expect. REFERENCE POINTS.</p>
<p><u>Bullish Signals</u></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>2-3 follow through buying days</li>
<li>Quiet price action subsequent to breakout</li>
<li>Reversal recovery from “squat”</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Bearish Signals</u></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Close below 20-day soon after breakout lowers odds of success</li>
<li>3 consecutive down days with NO SUPPORTIVE ACTION on day three
lowers odds of success</li>
<li>Wide price action (increased volatility) on volume lowers odds of
success</li>
</ol>
<p>We don’t want the stock to be whipping around after breakout. Alpha
not beta. We want it to breakout, get quiet, and pull-in on low volume
and then to shortly thereafter move higher. “Tennis Ball Action” after a
“Natural Reaction”. It will very often (~50%) pull back and retest the
breakout area. <b>Be OK with having a 4-7% gain vanish as it retests the
breakout area for a few days. This is where judging the theme/health of
the market will pay off. Are stocks moving higher or failing after the
initial breakout? Always pay attention to the theme as many of these
signals will happen together or across many names.</b></p>
<p>Quiet action following the b/o is ok. During a reversal or squat,
look for it to take out the high within a few days to a week or two.
Beware of violations or “bearish signals”. <b>Also consider – is there a
theme in the market? Noticing one or several of these things happening
over and over? </b></p>
<p>How many stages or bases has the stock already gone through? Many of
the stocks Mark is highlighting during this period (late Nov. 2013) are
somewhat suspect because it’s late in the market and things are getting
volatile. Keep this in mind – longer time frames at the beginning of a
new bull and shorten time frame as see warranted as market has been in
uptrend for some time. Volatility major clue.</p>
<p>Additional Notes:</p>
<p>David Ryan clarification: three lower low’s doesn’t apply (become as
concerning) if they are very minor price moves. Everything in
context.</p>
<p>Mark does not apply these signals to the general market. Is the
market distribution or accumulation dominant? That’s about all he cares
about and keeps it as simple as possible. FOLLOW THE STOCKS.</p>
<p>You’ll oftentimes get a “flight to quality” as the bull gets later
stage. This is where money goes into big caps and it’s a defensive play
(as we’ve seen for much of 2023). Don’t worry about stocks getting
downgraded by analysts. Many great names get downgraded and it shouldn’t
phase you - just follow price action.</p>
<p>Mark was mentioning how around this time the market was feeling like
a grind and not easy to make money. At this same time, I noticed the %
NAS stocks above 200-day was also deteriorating - failed to break higher
and had shortly thereafter put in a couple lower low’s.</p>
<p>MPA is NOT A MODEL PORTFOLIO. Mark will generally own the first few
that breakout up to 10-12 names maximum. Generally between 4-6
names.</p>

<p>How do you know which stocks to buy?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t have favorites</li>
<li><b> Buy in order of breakout </b></li>
<li>Don’t keep adding positions if trades are stopping you out.</li>
<li>Don’t keep trading the same size if trades are stopping you
out.</li>
<li>When things are working step up your exposure - build on
success.</li>
<li>When things are not working scale back.</li>
<li>Use forced displacement to add names when a stock is sold.</li>
</ol>
<p>What if you’re at a decent gain (~20%) within just a few days?</p>
<p>Very often what Mark will do is sell half into the strong move
upward. Selling half is a win-win. At that point, it is a free trade
even with the stop in the same place as it was originally. You don’t
want to move the stop up too quickly, and you want to let the stock go
through a natural reaction. Sometimes Mark will add it back as it breaks
out above the high of the natural reaction, then at that point, you can
raise your stop to breakeven or your initial buy point (NOT necessarily
the low of the natural reaction). Now your first half is nailed down and
second half is free rolled. This way you can hold through a second
natural reaction unless it makes a very accelerated move. If it moves up
significantly, Mark will just sell right into that.</p>
<p><a href="figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size2.png#round"><img

src="figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size3.png#round" class="img-thumbnail"
style="width:49.0%" /></a></p>
<p>Notice how the buys and add buys are still within the base. Mark is
only adding a 2nd buy if the stock is still within the base and actually
improving. Don’t do this to stocks that are running up and extended from
the base.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: <a
href="figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size4.png#round"><img
src="figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size4.png#round"
class="img-thumbnail" /></a></p>
<p>Mark lost almost nothing on this trade despite doubling his size on
the 2nd ‘Add’ buy. He did this by raising his full stop to below the
pivot of the handle. This locked in the gains from the 1st buy and he
took a normal, acceptable loss on the add. <b>Through these methods,
Mark effectively achieved asymmetrical leverage by increasing size to
win big if it works but lose almost nothing if it doesn’t.</b> ALWAYS
look to increase size and build larger positions while NEVER increasing
risk along with it. Do just the opposite: increase size without
increased risk.</p>
<p>When you add to an existing trade, how much do you add on the 2nd buy
(same size or smaller)?</p>
<p>It depends. Generally what I’ll do is double up on a position if I
add to it. Mark is big on going in with a smaller positions than normal
until things are working. <b>Once things are working, I don’t waste any
time. I go right in at a full position.</b> Once I have some traction
and I can see in the market that things are acting right, I go straight
in with a full-position. <b>If the market isn’t easy dollar, generally,
I’ll go in with a quarter or half position and double up each
time.</b></p>
<p>You don’t EVER have to be fully invested to make a big return. In
fact, Mark is oftentimes 50% in cash. Consider this - if in any given
year you can only make 100 trades, it doesn’t matter if you’re 100%
invested or 0% invested at times, or if you stay 25% invested at all
times with 75% cash at all times, either way it doesn’t matter. Your
results are the same either way, regardless of total exposure. <b>
Therefore, it is not necessary to have the feeling that you need to be
fully invested! </b></p>

</center>
<div class="box1">
<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>Mark: Many people think the breakout is the key. It’s not. The
quietting of price action around the supply area, is the key. It’s
telling you that supply has stopped coming to market. We don’t want a
stock with supply, that’s what leads to volatility. We want no supply
and a shit load of demand. This imabalance is what Jesse Livermore
called the ‘Line of least resistance.” It gets defined as the supply
gets weeded out of the market. Once you make this determination of a
stock setting up and supply being chewed through, then you want to watch
the stock after it breaks out. If it pulls back to the breakout area,
you want to watch for the stock to catch support, confirming the demand
for the stock. If it doesn’t catch support, it’s telling you that all
you have is retail buying and there’s no ’real’ demand for the stock.
This explains why after stocks breakout that have actually gone through
supply/demand dynamics, move very quickly. They can either move up or
down quickly, but it’s because of this imbalance. A little buying can
move it up quickly, but even a little selling will bring it right back
down.</p>
<p>After the breakout, you must assess- is this real institutional
demand or just retail traders breaking it out just from the chart?
That’s where you look for the follow through. The tennis balls/natural
reactions. If you get the setups, they’re breaking out, they’re
following through.. Now you know there’s an appetite for risk out
there.</p>
<p>Going into each day with a clear plan is what Mark Ritchie does to
stay in check and no overtrade. Have a plan each day and go into the day
ready to execute on nothing but YOUR plan. If that means only looking at
1-2 stocks, that’s all you look at. You have to figure out what works.
Try being more stringent with your rules- only certain RS stocks, only 1
setup, etc.</p>
<p>I need to be better at going into each day with a comprehensive plan
and LET NOTHING come into my mind that day. Have a complete plan and
have the discipline to follow it. Mark M. even said, you shouldn’t be
getting your ideas from ‘this’ service..</p>

<span style="color:#FFFF99">Q&amp;A Session June 2, 2023</span><br>

<div class="box1">
<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>The way to calculate RS (if you didn’t have access to RS) is take the
12-month ROC and sort the list from highest to lowest. Meaning, the
stocks that have gone up the most over the last 12-months are the
highest RS.</p>
<p>Mark M. rereads his own Mindset book while on the toilet.. lol. Very
important to keep these ideas fresh. Read a section each time you use
the bathroom..</p>
<p>You’ll likely never scale in perfectly during a new bull market or
scale out perfectly at the end of a bull. Just look to minimize
mistakes.. Don’t get hung up on being perfect.</p>
<p>PCVX, top winning stocks don’t look like this. Skewed out to the
right. Not ideal but maybe tradable.</p>
<p>Short base is 4-5 weeks minimum. 6-8 is what Mark likes to see,
minimum. Unless, PP, then 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>Always think risk vs reward.</p>
<p>No prejudice in the market. If you’re great, you’ll get rewarded. If
you’re not getting rewarded, you either don’t have the skill or the
market is bad. Mark Ritchie made more money on year 7 of his journey
than he did in the prior 6. Mark M. said the same. Develop the skill and
it will pay you for life.</p>
<p>If a stock has great fundamentals on the table, the only real
difference that makes in Mark Ritchies tactics is that he might play the
name for a larger move..</p>

<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>Q: Is FIX late stage base? <br></p>
<p>Don’t read into base counting too much. It’s mainly relevant after a
long drawn out bull market. But David Ryan said, be careful with base
counting b/c it can be subjective. Also, sometimes you can get climax
runs when late stage so don’t worry too much about late stage or not.
You’ll get stopped out either way. Remember what Ed Sykota said: “Go
where the momentum is.”</p>
<p>During good periods, Mark R. will oftentimes sell in thirds. But it
depends. The main thing is thinking about going in and out
incrementally. Half is great for psychological reasons.</p>
<p>Remember when adding, “Would I buy it here if I didn’t own it
already?” Also, it’s no problem to add more shares than the original buy
if the setup improves and you went in with a starter position.</p>
<p>Mark has learned over the years that, SMALL GAINS ADD UP. Happens
more often, less volatility in those original moves. As trade
progresses, it gets more volatile. Shorter-term helps with consistency,
but it’s a lot of work and requires more trading, when compared to
longer term trading / investing.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Not Losing Money</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent application of discipline</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thinking about something Mark said in the Q&amp;A session on Friday..
One of your main goals in the market should be to apply your discipline
consistently. Even if your discipline is not perfect, it’s important
that you apply it consistently. Then, after doing that for some time,
you can go through and critique / improve your discipline to achieve
superperformance. This is super relevant b/c last week I was questioning
my decision to sell 1:1 to finance risk, thinking, “we’ll it only
reduces my risk by $12 and I already have a small position.” This,
however, is not congruent with my goal. I need to be less concerned with
having perfect rules than I am about doing something consistently. It’s
ok if financing risk 1:1 isn’t perfect, I already know it will improve
my numbers, but it’s ok if not perfect. Just do it and do it
consistently. Then, after a few months, look back and critique it. You
should do this over and over and eventually you will have ‘critiqued’
everything about your strategy.</p>

<p>Comments about earnings:</p>
<p>On an earnings gap up while at a multiple of risk, even in an easy
dollar environment, Mark Ritchie will generally lighten up into that
strength. If many names are being sold and consistently moving higher
(costing you $ but great sign), then he might sell less to hold more for
a bigger move. <b>NEVER HOLD A LARGE POSITION INTO EARNINGS.</b> MR
holds into earings fairly regularly (with light position) when he’s at a
profit. If no profit, almost never holds into earnings.</p>
<p><u>MPA handling of GRBK (classic execution):</u></p>
<p><a href="figures/GRBK-MPAtactics.png#round"><img
src="figures/GRBK-MPAtactics.png#round" class="img-thumbnail" /></a></p>
<p>Pilot buys for Mark Ritchie are generally 1/10th of his full
position. In that case, 2.5% position. The goal isn’t to make money,
it’s “to see if I can make any money, or find any footing”. Like
sticking a mirror around the corner in old western movies.</p>
<p><u>Question:</u> If the market is selling off, do you start selling
positions and/or adjusting risk based on volatile market?</p>
<p><u>Answer:</u> I always default to the stocks. I never get my cue
from the market, always the stocks that I’m in. Now, if I’m feeling a
lot of pressure and am near my accepted portfolio dollar risk, I may
start lightening up or synching up stops, but never selling just because
general market is going down. STOCKS LEAD. Just like prior to 2020 COVID
crash.. We were stopped out of names several weeks before the market
really opened up (to the downside) that is because the stocks lead!
Never let the general market lead you.</p>
<p><b>Want to hold for a bigger move?</b></p>
<p>Wait to sell at a weekly close below the 10-week OR for three weekly
lower low’s and this will keep you in the best names that can make huge
moves. The best names won’t do this until the bulk of the move is over /
needs time to consolidate.</p>
<p><u>Example:</u> AXON back in 2003-2004, one of Mark’s great trades.
Notice how on weekly it never even closed before the 10-week MA during
its entire move up.</p>
<p><u>Mark: A batting average in the 20’s-30’s is about the worst it
gets.</u> Mine is just under 10%. This tells me I NEED TO BE MORE
SELECTIVE. This seems right considering I made several mistakes so far
this year that I’ve learned from and corrected: (1) realizing that MPA
isn’t a model portfolio and that Mark’s only buy a handful. Follow the
“trade blocks” template on the home page. I had in my head that Mark
“buys 90% of all names on the platform” and later realized that simply
isn’t true. (2) FOMO.</p>

<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>When Mark Ritchie wants to get 20-25% invested, he will typically do
that with 1-2 positions. This rally, he’s “taken more of a shotgun
approach” and has bought 4-5 names to get to 20-25%. The MPA platform
has 17-18 positions on and this is only to show what’s breaking out and
how they’re doing. This is supposed to be contrasted or compared with
our own trading so we can get an overall feel for the performance of our
strategy. Mark says that even though they have nearly 20 names on, the
most he would personally have is 4 to 5 or perhaps 6-8 partials
depending on conditions. MAX 8 names to start. They will NEVER actually
own this many names.</p>
<p>When it comes to fundamentals, the code 33 is the best b/c it is how
institutional investors operate. They look for earnings surprises,
breakout years on earnings, 3 quarters of accelerating earnings, sales,
margins; 2 quarters, etc. It’s all in the chapter “Fundamentals to focus
on” in Marks first book. These institutions have programs that pick out
companies with these fundamentals on the table. When it comes to shorter
time frame where you’re looking to get 10-15% gains, fundamentals don’t
really matter. However, if you want the key leaders and want to hold for
large moves, fundamentals become very important.</p>
<p>Recall the book, “How I made 2,000,000 in the stock market” by
Nicholas Darvas. He had a rule, the DOW must be in an uptrend for at
least 6-months before he would even consider buying.. <b> We’re not
looking to get the low. We’re looking to not lose money and wait for the
periods where we can get very aggressive and make a lot of money. The
low is meaningless! </b></p>
<p>When it comes to bad closes, using CBAY as an example, MONALERT was
showing nearly 2:1 violations to confirmations that were mostly the
result of poor closes prior to breakout. Mark say’s these ‘violations’
are mainly something he watches post-breakout and that they aren’t too
concerning to not buy because closes were tight, volume was drying up.
It certainly has the look so don’t get too worried about the closes
prior to breakout if everything else looks good.</p>
<p>HUBS made a huge correction. It’s just starting to turn up, has a
short little base. This is why it doesn’t make the cut.</p>
<p>AQUA had a proposed merger (shown as PM on Marketsmith chart) and
with this you need to be very careful. Could fall through. This has kept
Mark away from the name and is not even considering it.</p>

subsequent action is perfect example of reversal recovery.</b></p>
<p>It is very important that the volume comes down in the pivot. <b>The
combination of tight price action and low volume tells you that supply
is no longer coming to the market.</b> It doesn’t mean that supply will
come into the market, but it’s a good indication and gives you your best
shot at an explosive situation. The odds are in your favor. There could
always be sellers who come out of the woodwork who weren’t there at
lower prices.</p>

<p>It is technically a pullback buy if it takes out the high of the
previous day, but because of the recent market action, it’s not perfect
and not the best buy. Be more of a stickler during these periods and
recognize the nuance of this pullback buy that makes it less than ideal.
“It is acting pretty good though.” </font></p>
